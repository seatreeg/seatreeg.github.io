Deep learning, as a subject, is very complicated, so much so that most people go their entire lives without training a convolutional artificial neural network. <br><br>
To me, this is a tragedy, because deep learning is not only very cool, but is also surprisingly easy to get into. It requires <i> a little bit of programming knowledge </i>, but if you are new to programming entirely, I will be soon uploading an introduction to the topic that explains the smaller details. For now, you will need absolutely zero knowledge of python to read this article and even perform the process. Everything in this article uses Google Collab, which is a service that comes free with your Gmail account. Google Collab is nice because it allows you to begin coding without installing anything and can run intense code even if you have a low-end computer. <br> Lets begin with a (seemingly) simple problem.<br><br>
<em>OUR PROBLEM: </em> Jelly beans have many flavors that all look similar, yet not all of them are good (this is an objectively true statement, and if you disagree, I automatically know you are a jelly bean manufacturing exec). Even if you did somehow like all flavors, they don’t exactly mix well. Imagine eating a handful of lime jelly beans only for a few cinnamon ones to sneak their way in: it would be horrifically bad.<br> Sure, you could simply look at the jellybeans before eating them, but some of them are hard to differentiate. There are at least 4 different red jellybean flavors which look nearly identical. This is even more difficult if you are colorblind. What we need is a way to automatically filter the jellybeans by flavor.<br><br>
When I first began this project, I had many, <em>many</em> ideas on how to make this process as detailed as possible, and my advisor had to listen to every single one of them. While doing this process thoroughly may seem like a good thing, making the best possible jellybean sorter isn’t really the point. The point of this project is to make a tangible, accessible, and fun introduction to deep learning and statistics. There are many projects out there for deep learning, but many of them use intangible online training data, and often don’t produce a usable product. <br><br>
Personally, I think projects are 20x times more fun when you end up with a physical device at the end. It feels like you invented something. I would like to capture that experience with this project, so while you can use the data that I post on this blog, I highly encourage you to try making these yourself and collecting your own data (I will engineer everything to be as cheap as I can get away with). <br><br>
Experimenting with deep learning often involves a lot of guessing. You can use prior knowledge and experiments to find an answer more efficiently, but the process often ends up being guess and check (I call this <em>the two-step method of statistics:</em><br><br>
<strong>STEP 1:</strong> mess <strong>AROUND. </strong><br>
<strong>STEP 2: FIND OUT. </strong><br><br>
Let’s start step one with a simple method. Below I have a picture of the device I used to record a video of jellybeans. It is literally just two cups taped to a piece of paper and cardboard. <br><br>
Using the device, I filled the cup with 10 jellybeans of a specific flavor, then recorded 30 seconds of them being shook. I turned that video into 200 images and repeated the process for each flavor. These images will serve as <em>labeled data for supervised training</em>, where each image will have a label that says what flavor the image is of. We will then train a neural network to guess the jellybean flavor. We know the correct answers here, as they are in the label, and the goal is to get a neural network that guesses the correct answers as many times as possible.<br><br>
We will get into the details later, but for this first training setup I semi-arbitrarily chose the model to have 3 convolutional layers, 3 max pooling layers, and 2 dense hidden layers.<br>
<pre><code>
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(4, activation='softmax')  
])
